- - - 1. Domains Beyond Amazon.com - - - 
Adjusting the crawler for different domains will always require
an understanding of the html structure of the new domain. At the
very least, the amazonCrawler.js and productScraper.js scripts 
provide a framework to build on while working with a new domain.

amazonCrawler.js would require adjustments to the startCrawl() 
function in order to reach the proper category page of the new 
domain. The gatherProductLinks() function would also require 
some tweaking dependent on how the links on that category page
are structured. 

productScraper.js is heavily dependent on the html of the domain
that products are being gathered from. As of now, each feature of
each product that needs to be gathered is specifically pulled from the 
html of the product's source page. However, the overall functionality
of productScraper.js should be easy to replicate, and the product objects 
it creates can be adjusted without affecting how productScraper.js 
interacts with the amazonCrawler.js.

pageGrabber.js should already work with any page on any domain.

Adjusting to gather different kinds of products should be easier than
switching to different domains. 

amazonCrawler.js features a "productType" variable. While focusing
on Amazon as a domain, different categories of products can be 
accessed simply by changing the value of that variable (there are 
easily accessed category pages for "tools", "games", "movies", and 
more).

productScraper.js would require more effort to adjust for other products,
as the data it gathers is currently dependent on the product in question 
being a book. When amazonCrawler.js is given a different product type, 
productScraper will still correctly fetch the names and sourceURLs of 
new products but will not consistently gather the other details. 

It should also be noted that the number of products to gather can be 
easily adjusted in amazonCrawler.js. For excessively large batches of 
data, this current script configuration may not be sufficient - I'd 
adjust addProductToList() so that products were added to the current
json file as they were crafted. I'd also remove the "scraping product" 
updates that are sent to the console for each product.
